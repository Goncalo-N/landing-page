# landing-page
 A responsive and interactive portfolio landing page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page features a no-scroll design, allowing users to navigate through different sections via buttons, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. This project showcases my skills in front-end development and serves as the gateway to explore my work as a software developer.
